# Microsoft Champions League Hackathon

# Pneumo-sure - AI based Chest Radiology Assistant for Pneumonia and other Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases(COPD).

Dataset used : https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

Reference Dataset : https://www.rsna.org/en/education/ai-resources-and-training/ai-image-challenge/RSNA-Pneumonia-Detection-Challenge-2018

# Accuracy of the model - 91%

# Prerequisites

Make sure that you have the following:

* Python 3.6 and pip (which comes with Python 3+)
* All the mention libraries in Requirements.Txt File.

# Running the App

What each file does:
* ```app.py``` - runs the server and loads the user interface.
* ```app/templates/base.html``` - contains the base HTML
* ```app/templates/home.html``` - contains the body of the HTML
* ```app/templates/result.html``` - contains the final result of the HTML


# To run the app, complete the following steps:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.6 and a text editor installed.
2. Clone the repo using ```git clone https://github.com/vivektalwar13071999/Pneumo-sure.git```
3. Change the directory to ```Pneumo-sure``` where it is downloaded & saved ```cd filepath/Pneumo-sure```
4. Install the required packages using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.You can manually install them as you come across them if need be, but this will install them all for you. Note that if you add more packages, run pip freeze > requirements.txt to save them to your requirements file.
5. In the main directory  Run ```python3 app.py``` . 
6. A deployment server will start on local host ```127.0.0.1:5000``` and go to the web-browser and type this ```http://127.0.0.1:5000```
7. A screen with slogan (#Fighting Pneumonia using Artificial Intelligence) will appear and a Upload option will be given.
8. Upload a ```image``` file from the local computer and click on predict the result will appear on the screen in few moments.
